# notes-app
by mrivasperez

## About
notes-app is a Node.js CLI notes application. I built it as part of Andrew Meade's udemy course on Node.js. I learned very valuable development skills developing this application. I enjoyed greatly learning how I can use JavaScript to create changes in my computer's file system.

## Setting up
I'm excited for you to use my application to keep track of your notes in a very hacker-aesthetic way. Please use the following instructions and notes to get the application up and running on your local machine.
### Prerequesites
To get this application up and running you need the following:
- Node.js
- NPM

### Installing
- Before running this application. Please make sure Node.js and NPM are installed on your computer by running "node -v" and "npm -v" in your terminal or command line.
- Installing this application is as simple as cloning or downloading the repo onto your local machine. If you have node installed and the application files on your computer, there are no additional installation steps to worry about.
